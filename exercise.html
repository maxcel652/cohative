        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <article>
            <pre>
                At Cohative (from the Latin
                "cohaerere" meaning "to come
                together"), we believe that
                powerful brands are built on a
                foundation of collaboration
                and clear storytelling. We don't
                just create visuals; we craft
                narratives that resonate. Our
                approach is refreshingly
                collaborative - we work hand-
                in-hand with our clients to
                understand their vision,
                values, and target audience. 
                Through open communication
                and a shared creative journey,
                we translate those insights
                into compelling brand
                identities that not only look
                beautiful but also connect
                deeply with the hearts and
                minds of your customers.

        <h3>Our Core values</h3>
        <article>
            <pre>
                Cohesion: We believe in the
                strength of a unified vision.
                We work collaboratively with
                our clients to ensure all
                elements of their brand
                identity seamlessly come
                together.


                Clarity: We strive for clear
                communication in everything
                we do. Our designs are
                visually impactful and our
                narratives are easy to
                understand.


                Creativity: We are passionate
                about pushing boundaries and
                exploring new ideas. We bring
                a fresh perspective to every
                project.


                Connection: We believe in the
                power of storytelling to build
                meaningful connections
                between brands and their
                audiences.


                Collaboration: We value
                teamwork and believe the best
                results come from working
                together with our clients and
                each other.
